Ember-debonair is an oppinionated set of ESLint rules, addons, configurations, etc used throughout all [Ship Shape](https://shipshape.io) addons and apps.

This includes adding:
* [ember-cli-eslint](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-eslint)
* [ember-cli-sass](https://github.com/aexmachina/ember-cli-sass)
* [ember-cli-template-lint](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-cli-template-lint)
* [eslint-plugin-ship-shape](https://github.com/shipshapecode/eslint-plugin-ship-shape)
* [flexi](https://github.com/html-next/flexi)

The ESLint rules are very similar to the eslint-plugin-ember-suave ones, but a few have been changed.

### Code Climate / Test Coverage
`codeclimate-test-reporter` is added to the project, so that we can easily update test coverage stats using Travis.
